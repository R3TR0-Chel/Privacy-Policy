Encryption Compliance Documentation for App Store Review
App Name: Pod Zarplatu
Bundle ID: com.AlphaNet.podzarplatu
Developer: LLC Alpha-Net
Date: July 14, 2025

 Encryption Usage Statement
The mobile application Pod Zarplatu is developed using the Flutter framework with a backend powered by FastAPI, and it uses Google Firestore as the database.
The application uses encryption solely for the purpose of secure communication and data storage. All encryption is handled through standard, Apple-approved cryptographic libraries and protocols.
Specifically:
Data transmission between the mobile client and backend server is secured using TLS (HTTPS)
All connections to Firestore (Google Cloud Firestore) use encrypted channels via TLS
The app does not provide any messaging, payment processing, or cryptographic functionality that would require custom encryption
No sensitive encryption algorithms are implemented manually in the app
No peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted communication is involved
Declaration
The app does not use proprietary encryption algorithms or any encryption methods that fall outside of standard exemptions under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
All encryption is performed using standard APIs provided by the operating system and/or trusted third-party providers (e.g., Firebase and HTTPS libraries) and is used for secure communication purposes only.
